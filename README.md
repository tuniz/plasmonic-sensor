Paper Abstract: 
We evaluate the sensing properties of plasmonic waveguide sensors by calculating their resonant
transmission spectra in different regions of the non-Hermitian eigenmode space.
We elucidate the pitfalls of using modal dispersion calculations in isolation to predict plasmonic
sensor performance, which we address by using a simple model accounting for eigenmode excitation
and propagation. Our transmission calculations show that resonant wavelength and spectral width crucially
depend on the length of the sensing region, so that no single criterion obtained from modal 
dispersion calculations alone can be used as a proxy for sensitivity. Furthermore, 
we find that the optimal detection limits occur where directional coupling is supported, 
where the narrowest spectra occur. Such narrow spectral features can only be measured by filtering 
out all higher-order modes at the output, e.g., via a single-mode waveguide. Our calculations 
also confirm a characteristic square root dependence of the eigenmode splitting with respect 
to the permittivity perturbation at the exceptional point, which we show can be identified through 
the sensor beat length at resonance. This work provides a convenient framework for designing and 
characterizing plasmonic waveguide sensors when comparing with experimental measurements.
